                Once an AI product is functioning correctly (Level 1) and engaging users as intended (Level 2), the next 
                step is to ask: Is this product actually changing how users think, feel, or act in ways that are in line 
                with the product's intended purpose? This level is essential because users' psychological and behavioral 
                changes often serve as early indicators of whether a product is likely to achieve its long-term development 
                goals (e.g., improving health outcomes or educational gains). Compared to full-scale impact evaluations, 
                these user evaluations are faster and cheaper, and they allow product developers to iterate rapidly based 
                on real-world feedback.

                      One key behavioral metric is how often and how deeply users engage via queries. Increased <strong>frequency of interactions</strong> with an educational AI can signal greater curiosity and learning gains. For example, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?q=source%3A%22British+Journal+of+Educational+Technology%22&ff1=pubReports+-+Research&ff2=subLearner+Engagement&id=EJ1427270#:~:text=the%20control%20group%20utilized%20rule,regulation%20behaviours" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-taf-blue hover:text-taf-blue/80 underline">a recent study</a> with a chatbot "study coach" found that the <strong>number of chatbot interactions</strong> was a significant positive predictor of improvements in students' self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviors. In practice, as learners become more confident, they tend to ask more questions and explore topics further. The <strong>depth of queries</strong> can also be informative ‚Äì if over time users progress from basic factual questions to more advanced, specific inquiries, it indicates knowledge growth. <a href="https://moldstud.com/articles/p-essential-benchmarking-metrics-for-evaluating-e-learning-success#:~:text=Analyze%20user%20behavior%20data%20to,learners%20progressing%20to%20subsequent%20sections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-taf-blue hover:text-taf-blue/80 underline">Learning analytics</a> often track whether learners <strong>move on to advanced content or modules</strong> as a proxy for learning progression. In other words, an upward trend in both the <em>quantity</em> of questions and the <em>complexity</em> or specificity of those questions is generally viewed as evidence that the user's curiosity, confidence, and understanding are increasing over time.

                      Another measurable outcome is the complexity of the language that users employ. As users learn and gain expertise, their vocabulary, syntax, and overall linguistic sophistication in queries or contributions may become more advanced. Empirical studies support this connection between language complexity and cognitive development. For instance, students tended to write lengthier, more complex sentences when <a href="https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/390338/1/1761_Article_Text_8498_1_10_20160728.pdf#:~:text=scores,The%20negative%20association%20of%20positive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-taf-blue hover:text-taf-blue/80 underline">engaging in in-depth learning tasks</a>. Thus, if a user's questions and messages show increasing use of advanced terminology or more complex sentence structures over time, it can serve as a <strong>proxy for cognitive gains</strong> and growing mastery of the subject matter.

                      Follow-up questions ‚Äì cases where a user asks a new question related to the previous answer ‚Äì are a strong indicator of sustained engagement. Rather than being satisfied with a single answer, a curious or motivated learner will probe deeper, ask for clarification, or explore related aspects of a topic. Frequent follow-up questions suggest the AI is prompting deeper thinking rather than one-off answers. While direct experimental measures of "follow-up rate" are still emerging, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2022/02/22/engine-achievement-role-curiosity-learner-engagement/#:~:text=Curiosity%20is%20an%20important%20condition,classrooms%20to%20increase%20learner%20engagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-taf-blue hover:text-taf-blue/80 underline">educational theory</a> emphasizes that students who ask more questions tend to be more actively engaged and curious in their learning. Thus, a rising follow-up question rate can be interpreted as the user maintaining interest and an inquiry mindset. It's important, however, to distinguish <em>productive</em> follow-ups from those caused by confusion; ideally, increasing follow-ups reflect genuine curiosity (e.g. "That makes sense ‚Äì what about <em>X</em>?") rather than misunderstanding. Some conversational learning systems monitor the <strong>average dialogue turns per query</strong> as an engagement metric ‚Äì longer conversational exchanges often mean the learner is digging deeper. In summary, a high or growing follow-up question rate is generally a <strong>positive sign of engagement and intellectual curiosity</strong>, aligning with research that links student question-asking to active learning and higher-order thinking.

                      Modern educational AI platforms often include specific features or recommendations intended to drive learning actions (for example, a chatbot might suggest "Would you like to try a practice quiz on this topic?" or provide links to further reading). <strong>Feature utilization rate</strong> ‚Äì whether users actually use these suggested tools or follow the AI's advice ‚Äì can reveal much about user trust and motivation. High follow-through rates on AI suggestions imply that the user not only finds the suggestions useful but also <strong>trusts the AI's guidance</strong> enough to act on it. In <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/why-is-it-so-hard-for-ai-to-win-user-trust/#:~:text=The%20study%E2%80%99s%20findings%20rejected%20the,and%2C%20consequently%2C%20on%20user%20performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-taf-blue hover:text-taf-blue/80 underline">a study</a> on AI recommendations and user trust, researchers found that participants' trust in the AI grew when <strong>following the AI's advice led to positive outcomes</strong>, and users who saw good results tended to rely on the AI more over time. In an educational context, if an AI tutor suggests an optional exercise and the learner consistently accepts and completes it, that behavior signals both trust in the AI and a high level of motivation to learn. Conversely, low uptake of recommended activities might indicate either low user trust, low perceived relevance of the suggestions, or lack of motivation.

                  These on-platform metrics are essentially <strong>digital trace data</strong> that, when aggregated, provide a picture of user progress. Modern learning analytics and user analytics often use such data to infer engagement and learning. The advantage is that they are <strong>continuously collected</strong> and can often be analyzed in real-time. However, it's important to validate that these behavioral proxies truly reflect the intended outcomes (hence often combined with surveys or assessments).

                          Research into existing validated psychological questionnaires (even if shortened) that measure latent constructs like self-efficacy, motivation, or emotional state. For example, educational AI chatbots can measure self-rated knowledge gain ("I learned something new today"), confidence level ("I am more confident in solving these problems on my own"), emotional state ("Using this app made me feel motivated to keep learning"), or behavioral intention ("After chatting with the AI, I plan to try the recommended technique in real life"). Short <strong>psychometrically-sound</strong> surveys can capture such outcomes with surprising depth if designed well.

                          To avoid survey fatigue and interruptions with AI conversations, only a handful of well-chosen questions should be asked at a time. A mix of multiple-choice rating scales and one open-ended question can yield both quantitative and qualitative insight. For instance, after a chatbot session, a survey might pop up with 3 questions: (1) "How helpful was the advice you received?" (Likert scale), (2) "How did you feel during the conversation?" (perhaps using emoji or scale from frustrated to encouraged), and (3) an optional open text: "What was the most useful part of this interaction?"

For example, in a learning app, as a user progresses, the topics they discuss might shift from fundamental concepts to more advanced ones ‚Äì indicating cognitive growth. Topic modeling can track this progression. It can also surface <em>unexpected</em> themes ‚Äì e.g., users frequently bringing up "exam anxiety" ‚Äì which might signal an affective need that the product could address.

This works even across multiple languages, simply by prompting the model (e.g. "On a scale of 1‚Äì5, how much self-confidence does this message show?"). Such AI-based analysis could generate a profile of each user's conversation: for example, <em>sentiment trend: positive</em>, <em>confidence expressed: moderate and rising</em>, <em>themes: independence 3/5, belongingness 4/5</em>. These quantified scores from text allow for tracking subtle changes. Of course, using AI to evaluate AI interactions must be done carefully (to avoid bias or over-interpretation), but it opens a path for <strong>scalable qualitative analysis</strong>.

These are more <strong>impact-level metrics</strong>, but measured in a shorter-term, they can serve as strong evidence of user-level change (e.g., an improvement in a practice test score after using the AI tutor for a month). <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4895486#:~:text=These%20tutors%20comprise%20about%2015,successful%2C%20perform%20worse%20on%20their" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-taf-blue hover:text-taf-blue/80 underline">A field experiment</a> in a high school illustrated this by integrating an AI tutor into part of the curriculum and then examining students' subsequent test performance.
